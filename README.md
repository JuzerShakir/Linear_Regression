## Linear Regression
### Definition
A linear equation that models a function such that if we give any `x` to it, it will predict a value `y` , where both `x and y` are input and output varaibles respectively. These are numerical and continous values.

It is the most simple and well known algorithm used in machine learning.

<br>

The above Flowchart represents that we choose our training set, feed it to an algorithm, it will learn the patterns and will output a function called `Hypothesis function 'H(x)'`. We then give any `x` value to that function and it will output an estimated `y` value for it.

For historical reasons, this function `H(x)` is called `hypothesis function.`


### Univariate Linear Regression
#### Definition
When you have one feature / variable `x` as an input to the function to predict `y`, we call this `Univariate Linear Regression` problem.
