## Description
A quick guide and understanding of how famous Machine Learning Algorithms work. Also given links to other study materials in order to understand the concepts more concretly.

## Notations
- `m` ðŸ‘‰ Number of Training Examples.
- `x` ðŸ‘‰ "input" variable / features.
- `y` ðŸ‘‰ "ouput" variable / "target" variable.
- `(x, y)` ðŸ‘‰ One training example.
- `x`<sub>i</sub> , `y`<sub>i</sub>  ðŸ‘‰ i<sup>th</sup> training example.
- `x`<sub>i<sub>j</sub></sub> ðŸ‘‰ i<sup>th</sup> training example of the j<sup>th</sup> column / feature.


## Linear Regression
### Definitions
A linear equation that models a function such that if we give any `x` to it, it will predict a value `y` , where both `x and y` are input and output varaibles respectively and also numerical.

It is the most simple and well known algorithm used in machine learning.
