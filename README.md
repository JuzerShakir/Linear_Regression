- `x` ðŸ‘‰ "input" variable / features.
- `y` ðŸ‘‰ "ouput" variable / "target" variable.
- `(x, y)` ðŸ‘‰ One training example.
- `x`<sub>i</sub> , `y`<sub>i</sub>  ðŸ‘‰ i<sup>th</sup> training example.
- `x`<sub>i<sub>j</sub></sub> ðŸ‘‰ i<sup>th</sup> training example of the j<sup>th</sup> column / feature.

## Linear Regression
### Definition
A linear equation that models a function such that if we give any `x` to it, it will predict a value `y` , where both `x and y` are input and output varaibles respectively. These are numerical and continous values.

It is the most simple and well known algorithm used in machine learning.

<br>

The above Flowchart represents that we choose our training set, feed it to an algorithm, it will learn the patterns and will output a function called `Hypothesis function 'H(x)'`. We then give any `x` value to that function and it will output an estimated `y` value for it.

For historical reasons, this function `H(x)` is called `hypothesis function.`


### Univariate Linear Regression
#### Definition
When you have one feature / variable `x` as an input to the function to predict `y`, we call this `Univariate Linear Regression` problem.

#### Formula

<p align='center'>H(x) = Î¸<sub>0</sub> + Î¸<sub>1</sub>x</p>

Other way of representing this formula as what we are familiar with:

<p align='center'>H(x) = b + mx</p>

> Where :
>- b = Î¸<sub>0</sub> ðŸ‘‰ y intercept
>- m = Î¸<sub>1</sub> ðŸ‘‰ slope
>- x = x ðŸ‘‰ feature / input variable
